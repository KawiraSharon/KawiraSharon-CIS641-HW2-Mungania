#ABOUT ME

- I love reading ambiguous publications, deciphering what they mean and writing my own version of the publications. I hope that my interest in reading coupled with my thirst for knowledge eventually results in my making contributions in the field of medicine using software engineering.

- When I am not studying or learning new things, I enjoy staying indoors and watching anime movies, my all time favorite one being Shingeki no Kyojin, which is Japanese for Attack on Titan.

- I enjoy long drives and car karaoke sessions.
