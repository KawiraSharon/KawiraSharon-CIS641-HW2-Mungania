# SHARON KAWIRA MUNGANIA

- I love reading ambiguous publications, deciphering what they mean and writing my own version of the publications. I hope that my interest in reading coupled with my thirst for knowledge eventually results in my making contributions in the field of medicine using software engineering.

- When I am not studying or learning new things, I enjoy staying indoors and watching anime movies, my all time favorite one being Shingeki no Kyojin, which is Japanese for Attack on Titan.

- I enjoy long drives and car karaoke sessions.

## Technical Background
I am a passionate fullstack software engineer with a particular interest in backend engineering. I love to work with databases, server-side scripting languages, APIs, and server architecture to ensure seamless communication between front-end and back-end systems. I also enjoy identifying and resolving problems as they arise during the development process. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Applied Computer Science specializing in Software Engineering at Grand Valley State University.
